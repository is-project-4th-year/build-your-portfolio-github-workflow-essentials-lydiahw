## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

List at least **four key concepts or skills** you learned during the Git crash course. For each one, write a brief explanation of how it helped you manage your portfolio project more effectively.

Example format:

- **Cloning**: Learnt how to clone a repository which allows me to work on a collaboration project from my IDE remotely.

-**Issues**: Working with issues allowed me to visually keep track of progress made within a milestone.

**Milestones**: Allowed me to slowly break down the massive project into smaller manageable parts.

**Merge**: This helped me review the overall code before adding it into the main branch and greatly reduced errors.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features
